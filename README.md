# DQN Agent for Demon Attack (Atari)

A Deep Q-Network (DQN) implementation using Stable Baselines3 to play the Demon Attack Atari game.

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Run experiments in parallel (faster if GPU allows)
python train.py --mode experiments --parallel --workers 2

# Resume interrupted experiments (default behavior)
python train.py --mode experiments

# Force re-run all experiments
python train.py --mode experiments --no-resume

## Hyperparameter Experiments

We tested 10 different hyperparameter configurations to find the optimal settings for Demon Attack:

### Experiment Configurations

### Results (500,000 timesteps each)

| Experiment       | Mean Reward | Std Dev | Best Eval Reward | Episodes |

| **high_gamma**   | 7.80        | 10.81   | **36.4**         | 6728     |

| slow_exploration | —           | —       | 11.0             | —        |
| high_final_eps   | —           | —       | —                | —        |
| optimized        | —           | —       | —                | —        |

> **Note**: Experiments marked with "—" did not complete fully. `slow_exploration` has partial evaluation data; `high_final_eps` and `optimized` were interrupted before completion.

**Best Configuration**: `high_gamma` (γ=0.999) achieved the highest evaluation reward of **36.4**, showing that long-term reward consideration is crucial for Demon Attack.

## Key Features

### Resumable Experiments

**Challenge**: Training 10 experiments sequentially takes many hours. If the terminal is killed mid-training, all progress could be lost.

**Solution**: The training script now supports resumable experiments:

- Completed experiments are automatically detected and skipped on restart
- Checkpoints are saved every 50,000 timesteps for recovery
- Best model is saved whenever evaluation improves
- Results are aggregated from disk, so any completed experiment counts

```bash
# Resume from where you left off
python train.py --mode experiments

# Force re-run even completed experiments
python train.py --mode experiments --no-resume
```

### Parallel Experiment Execution

**Challenge**: Running experiments sequentially is slow. With sufficient hardware resources, multiple experiments could run simultaneously.

**Solution**: Parallel execution using multiprocessing:

- Run N experiments simultaneously with `--parallel` flag
- Control worker count with `--workers N` (default: 2)
- Each worker handles one complete experiment
- Results still aggregated correctly from disk

```bash
# Run 2 experiments at a time
python train.py --mode experiments --parallel

# Run 3 experiments at a time (requires more GPU memory)
python train.py --mode experiments --parallel --workers 3
```

**Memory Consideration**: Each DQN model uses ~2-4GB GPU memory. Only increase workers if you have sufficient VRAM.

### Additional Features

- Automatic hyperparameter experiment logging
- TensorBoard integration for training visualization
- Best model checkpoint saving (every 10k eval steps)
- Periodic checkpoint saves (every 50k training steps)
- Greedy Q-policy for evaluation (deterministic action selection)
- Results aggregation across all completed experiments
